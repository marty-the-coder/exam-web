# Making a function that firstly checks if the player guesses the exact right number, using the "DIFF" as the difference between
    # the guess and the actual temp, and "bc -l" because we needed basic calculator with integer calculations because the difference
    # often will be with decimal points
    if (( $(echo "$DIFF == 0" | bc -l) )); then
        # then printing out this message
        echo "Wow! You got it on the dot! How did you manage to do that??"
    # checking this condition if the last condition is not met, so if the guess is not exactly right, it checks if the differnce is
    # less than 3 degrees with the same logic as the last one
    elif (( $(echo "$DIFF < 3" | bc -l) )); then
        # if the difference is less than 3 degrees, we print out this message
        echo "Congratulations! The actual temperature in ${CITY_NAME} is ${ACTUAL_TEMP}°C. You won!"
    # we made this condition that will print out a message if none of the conditions above are met, i.e. if the guessed temperature
    # is not equal to or less than 3 degrees away from the actual temperature (the user looses)
    else
        # then we print out this message 
        echo "Sorry, the actual temperature in ${CITY_NAME} is ${ACTUAL_TEMP}°C. Better luck next time!"
